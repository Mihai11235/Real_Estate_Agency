# Real_Estate_Agency
A console interface application written in C, used to manage a real estate agency. 
The app was created to show how C language can be more difficult to use than C++ language when it comes to this kind of applications because of how difficult memory management can be.
Poor memory management can lead to memory leaks that can cause memory violation errors if the programmer tries to access a freed area of memory or the application being laggy if he doesn't free the memory at all.
